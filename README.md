## OOP in C
- Inclusion polymorphism and "objects" implemented in C
- Purpose is to understand OOP languages better
- Implemented generic heap and heapnode "classes" with ability to have different datatypes as payloads and different implementations of methods for comparing, swapping, cloning, getting key, and destructing
- Tested by solving "interval partitioning" problem which can rely heavily on common heap operations with diff payloads.
