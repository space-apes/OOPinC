OOP in C
    -Inclusion polymorphism and "objects" implemented in C
    -Purpose is to understand OOP languages better
    -Implemented generic heap and heapnode "classes" with ability to have different datatypes as payloads
        and different implementations in implementations for comparing, swapping, cloning, and getting key
    -Tested by solving "interval partitioning" problem which can rely heavily on common heap operations with diff payloads.
